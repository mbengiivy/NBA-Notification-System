# NBA-Notification-System
##Description:
THis is a system that sends an alert via sms or text(according to preference) to a user over the NBA game stats using Amazon SNS.
It implements the use of ##AWS Lambda, AWS Simple Notification Service, Amazon EventBridge and Amazon IAM 

##Prerequisites:
1. A functional AWS account
2. An API key from sportsdata.io(IT'S FREE!)

The task is to set up the system to send notifications on the game stats. I took the challenge to upgrade my code to not only send game notifications but also send stadiums available as well. 
I also got the chance to learn the AWS services more and interact with different settings eg. roles and policies.
